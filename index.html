								<h2>Introduction</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								I'm a 28-year-old Business Analyst with a love for data, who firmly believes in automation (especially in enviroments that aren't 
								optimized for it). My main beliefs are those of information sharing (for example a central knowledge hub), finding solutions for problems, 
								not the people who caused it (pointing fingers), and actionable reporting (don't make dashboards just because you like looking at them).  <br><br>

								Reports and dashboards have to have a purpose and be actionable. There's no reason to have hundredrs of dashboard 
								when no one knows what to do with it or how to interpret it.<br><br> 

								When there are repetitive manual tasks happening, first you have to wonder if it's even worth doing them, secondly you have to 
								automate them as much as possible with the tools at your disposal. Every repetitive task that has to be done manually are hours that 
								are lost for no good reason. The snippets on this website might help you in enviroments that aren't optimzed for automation.

							Because I want to help others automate (boring) tasks, I've listed some snippets on a separate page.
							These aren't perfect snippets, nor do I pretend they are. My main intention is to give examples to others
							as to what they can automate and how they could possible go around doing so.
						</p>
						<p>
							These automations are written in VBA, PowerShell and Power Query M. They aren't meant as a way to show off 
							my skills - as some of them are even written by others. A lot of these snippets wouldn't even be necessary 
							with a proper data sharing platform, but sometimes you have to work with what you got.

					During my school life (and still to this day) I've always been interested in science and data. 
					The way you can model the world, analyze it and turn those results into improvements inside and outside of your 
					personal life is amazing to me. We're living in a rapidly evolving world and we have to evolve with it. 
					That's why I personally believe that education is a good basis to have, but it's once your start developing 
					certain skills and skillsets that you can really make a difference. My main focus right now is on automation 
					(even in limited enviroments) and data analysis to improve the lives of everyone evolved.

						<h2>Skills</h2>
						<ul class="">
							<li><b>DAX</b>
								<br>The last few years I've been building a lot of reports in Power BI (and Excel - Power Pivot)
									whereby knowledge of DAX is crucial. Especially when it comes to building measures that are 
									easy to maintain and are easily used withing time intelligence.
							</li>
							<li><b>Power Query M</b>
								<br>Crucial part of loading data into your data model in Excel and Power BI. Knowing how to write 
									M and not just using the GUI can make a massive difference in performance. Understanding what 
									you're doing and using loops, variables, etc. where needed will help you enormously.
							</li>
							<li><b>PowerShell</b>
								<br>Mostly learned to use this in a nonorthodox way, because other alternatives weren't available. 
									Using COM objects to interact with Office, I've been able to automate a plethora of otherwise 
									boring, repeating tasks.
							</li>
							<li><b>Python</b>
								<br>It has been a while since I've used Python in a professional context (mostly due to limitations), 
									but I have a broad basis in Python (used it in University) and I know how to use pandas to 
									do data analysis and manipulation.
							</li>
							<li><b>VBA</b>
								<br>This might not be loved as much as it used to, but it still has very useful tricks up its sleeves. 
									In combination with PowerShell you can make very powerful, user-agnostic scripts.
